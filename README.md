# AnotherQubitBitesTheDust - QHack22

## Project: QGenes

### Description of the project

Developments in microarray technologies have revolutionized life sciences by giving us the capability to simultaneously measure thousands of gene expression values. This presents us with the golden opportunity to use quantum computers to process these vast amount of information to train machine learning models, which we can use to accurately predict the possibility of developing genetic disorders from gene expressions of particular individuals.
